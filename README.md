# VottunBridge Multisig Implementation
## Qubic Grants & Incubation Proposal

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the implementation of a comprehensive multisig (multi-signature) security layer for VottunBridge, the critical infrastructure connecting Qubic network with EVM-compatible blockchains. The project will replace the current single-administrator architecture with a decentralized governance model requiring multiple approvals for critical operations, significantly enhancing security and trustworthiness of cross-chain asset transfers.

**Total Investment**: $21,000 USD (paid in Qus)
**Duration**: 10 weeks (4 milestones)

---

## 2. Business Need

### Current Situation

VottunBridge currently operates with a **single administrator system**:
- Single admin account (`id admin`) controls critical operations
- Manager list allows individual manager approval for operations
- Critical functions like `completeOrder`, `refundOrder`, and `transferToContract` require only 1 manager signature
- Single point of failure vulnerability for fund management

### Problem

This architecture presents security risks:
- Compromised admin key = complete system control
- Single manager approval insufficient for large value transfers
- No distributed control mechanism
- Limited audit trail for critical decisions

### Solution

Implement a multisig wallet system similar to MsVault reference implementation:
- Multiple owner approval requirements
- Configurable approval thresholds (M-of-N signatures)
- Distributed control over critical bridge operations
- Complete approval tracking and audit trail

---

## 3. Business Model

### Value Proposition

**Enhanced Security**: Multiple signature requirements prevent single point of failure and unauthorized fund movements.

**Operational Benefits**:
- Distributed responsibility across multiple owners
- Transparent approval process
- Recoverability in case of compromised individual keys
- Alignment with security best practices for bridge infrastructure

### Implementation Approach

This implementation follows the MsVault reference model, adapting its proven multisig architecture to VottunBridge's specific requirements for cross-chain order management.

- Operations require threshold approval
- All approvals logged immutably
- Owner/threshold management without redeployment

## 7. User Journey Examples

### Journey 1: Bridge Order Completion (Happy Path)

1. User initiates bridge transfer from EVM to Qubic
2. Order is created in the system
3. Manager 1 reviews and approves
4. Manager 2 approves (threshold met)
5. Order executes automatically
6. User receives tokens on destination chain

---

### Journey 2: Refund Order

1. User's bridge order fails (network issue, insufficient liquidity, etc.)
2. User requests refund
3. Manager 1 verifies failure and approves refund
4. Manager 2 approves (threshold met)
5. Refund executes, user receives original tokens back

---

### Journey 3: Modify Multisig Configuration

1. Current owners decide to add a new owner
2. Owner 1 proposes the change
3. Owner 2 approves (threshold met)
4. New owner is added to the multisig wallet
5. Future operations now require approval from the expanded owner set
