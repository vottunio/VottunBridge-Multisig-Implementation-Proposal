# VottunBridge Multisig Implementation
## Qubic Grants & Incubation Proposal

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the implementation of a comprehensive multisig (multi-signature) security layer for VottunBridge, the critical infrastructure connecting Qubic network with EVM-compatible blockchains. The project will replace the current single-administrator architecture with a decentralized governance model requiring multiple approvals for critical operations, significantly enhancing security and trustworthiness of cross-chain asset transfers.

**Total Investment**: $21,000 USD (paid in Qus)
**Duration**: 10 weeks (4 milestones)
**Team Size**: 4 specialized developers

---

## 2. Business Need

### Current Problem

VottunBridge currently operates with a **single point of failure**:
- One admin account controls all critical operations
- Single manager approval can execute fund transfers
- No audit trail for decision-making
- High risk of compromised keys leading to total fund loss
- Lacks institutional-grade security standards required for DeFi

### Market Context

Cross-chain bridges are the **#1 attack vector** in blockchain:
- $2.5B+ stolen from bridges in 2022-2023
- 90% of attacks exploited centralized control mechanisms
- Institutional investors **require multisig** as minimum security standard
- Regulatory frameworks (MiCA, etc.) increasingly mandate distributed control

### Business Impact

Without multisig, VottunBridge faces:
- ❌ Limited institutional adoption
- ❌ Higher insurance costs
- ❌ Regulatory compliance risks
- ❌ Reduced user confidence
- ❌ Competitive disadvantage vs. secure bridges (LayerZero, Wormhole)

### Opportunity

Implementing multisig positions VottunBridge as:
- ✅ Enterprise-grade secure infrastructure
- ✅ Compliant with institutional standards
- ✅ Attractive for high-value transfers ($1M+)
- ✅ Reference implementation for Qubic ecosystem

## 3. Business Model

### Value Proposition

**For Users**:
- Sleep soundly: No single person can steal funds
- Transparency: All approvals visible on-chain
- Recoverability: Lost key ≠ lost funds

**For Qubic Ecosystem**:
- Trust anchor: Secure bridge = network credibility
- Institutional gateway: Opens doors to TradFi
- Developer template: Reusable multisig pattern for other dApps

### Target Users

1. **Institutional Investors** (Primary)
   - DAOs managing treasuries
   - Funds bridging >$100k
   - Exchanges integrating Qubic

2. **High-Net-Worth Individuals**
   - Users transferring $10k+
   - Long-term Qubic holders

3. **Development Teams**
   - Projects needing secure treasury management
   - Multisig as infrastructure primitive

### Revenue Model (Bridge Operators)

- **Current**: 0.1% bridge fee
- **Enhanced Value**: Ability to charge premium fees for multisig security
- **Volume Growth**: 3-5x increase expected from institutional adoption

```

**Key Design Principles**:
- **Defense in Depth**: Multisig on both chains
- **Fail-Safe**: Operations halt if threshold not met
- **Auditable**: All approvals logged immutably
- **Upgradeable**: Owner/threshold changes without redeployment

## 7. User Journey Examples

### Journey 1: Bridge Order Completion (Happy Path)

1. User initiates bridge transfer from EVM to Qubic
2. Order is created in the system
3. Manager 1 reviews and approves
4. Manager 2 approves (threshold met)
5. Order executes automatically
6. User receives tokens on destination chain

---

### Journey 2: Refund Order

1. User's bridge order fails (network issue, insufficient liquidity, etc.)
2. User requests refund
3. Manager 1 verifies failure and approves refund
4. Manager 2 approves (threshold met)
5. Refund executes, user receives original tokens back

---

### Journey 3: Modify Multisig Configuration

1. Current owners decide to add a new owner
2. Owner 1 proposes the change
3. Owner 2 approves (threshold met)
4. New owner is added to the multisig wallet
5. Future operations now require approval from the expanded owner set
